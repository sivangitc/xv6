usertrap called syscall

its 7 and it represents the system call exec

The printed sstatus is 0x22.
The spp bit (8) is 0 so the previous privilege level was user

80001ff6:	00002683	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
a3 is num

it crashes because 0 is one of the unused addresses so it is not mapped
the scause is d and it says that it means Load page fault which makes sense because we are trying to read from a page that doesnt exist


initcode was running with pid 1
